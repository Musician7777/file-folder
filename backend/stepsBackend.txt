Project setup
-npm init -y
-install the express (javascript based framework)
-install nodemon  (helps in running the node app.js,it runs autometically when something changes in the file)
-install dotenv and cors

Boilerplate Code
-require the express
-make it usable by putting in the App = express()
-use app.get to define the route
-use the app.listen to define in which port your app is going to listen

Entrypoint of the Code
-server.js
--use server.js file to define and use the port where the web is going to listen
--use app.use(cors()) on app.js file to verify that web is listen on the given domain
--use .env to define the port no. and config using (dotenv.config()) and use with (process.env.Port) port in this case
Change in package.json file
-main => server.js
-then run npx nodemon 
-the server.js is now the Entrypoint of or code 

Export anything
-use (module.exports = <what_you_want_to_export>) like app in this case
